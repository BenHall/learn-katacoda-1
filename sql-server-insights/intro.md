After completing this scenario, users will be able to register a system with
Red Hat Insights and resolve an Insight provided for Microsoft SQL Server running on the machine.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Register a system with Red Hat Insights
* View Insights triggered for the system on cloud.redhat.com
* Reconcile an Insight for the system running SQL Server
* Validate resolution by running the commands suggested by insights
* Confirm that SQL Server is running at the end of this exercise

# Example Usecase:
A system administrator running SQL Server on RHEL, is not yet familiar with all the best practices
to run SQL Server on RHEL. The system administrator depends on insights to provide the proactive 
insights to configure their SQL Server instance on RHEL.
