# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, and modify RHEL tuned profiles using tuned-adm, and see the impact of that change with Microsoft SQL Server''s columnstore feature.

> Columnstore indexes were first introduced in SQL Server 2012. Column stores offer a new way to store the data from a table that improves the performance of certain query types by at least ten times. With column stores They are especially helpful with fact tables in data warehouses.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Verify whether SQL Server is installed on the system
* View the currently set RHEL tuned-profile 
* Check SQL Server query performance by running an sample analytic query with columnstores
* Change the RHEL tuned-profile for SQL Server
* Query SQL Server with columnstores to see the impact of the mssql tuned profile
