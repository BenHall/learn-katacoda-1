# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, and modify RHEL tuned profiles using tuned-adm, and see the impact of that change with Microsoft SQL Server's columnstore feature.

>**BACKGROUND:** Columnstore indexes were first introduced in SQL Server 2012. Columnstore feature is available on SQL Server on Linux, and it  offers a new way to store the data in a columnar fashion. This improves the performance of certain analytical queries by at least ten times and are extremely useful in data warehousing scenarios.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Verify whether SQL Server is installed on the system
* View the currently set RHEL tuned-profile 
* Check SQL Server query performance by running an sample analytic query with columnstores
* Change the RHEL tuned-profile for SQL Server
* Query SQL Server with columnstores to see the impact of the mssql tuned profile
