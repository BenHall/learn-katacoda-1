# Validate the Environment
Using the provided system terminal session, validate the initial environment. 

Run the ansible command with the --version flag to see not only the version of Ansible that's installed, but also a few other key details:

`ansible --version`{{execute}}

<pre class="file">
DEFAULT
</pre>

This output will become more useful the deeper you get into Ansible.
