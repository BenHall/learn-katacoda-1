# Validate the Environment
Using the provided system terminal session, validate the initial environment. 

Run the ansible command with the --version flag to see not only the version of Ansible that's installed, but also a few other key details:

`ansible --version`{{execute}}

<pre class="file">
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = ['/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.6.8 (default, Jan 11 2019, 02:17:16) [GCC 8.2.1 20180905 (Red Hat 8.2.1-3)]
</pre>

This output will become more useful the deeper you get into Ansible.

In Ansible, the inventory represents the machines that Ansible will manage. Without an inventory, you would have a set of playbooks that define your desired system state, but wouldnâ€™t know which machines you needed to run them against.

By default, Ansible will read /etc/ansible/hosts as its default inventory file. 

In this example, we will create a inventory file called 'myhosts' that defines the machines in which SQL Server should be configured. In this example, we will call our inventory file myhosts, and we will add one group called [[sqlgroup]]:

`echo "[sqlgroup]" > myhosts`{{execute}}

Next, add the host to the group.

`echo localhost ansible_connection=local >> myhosts`{{execute}}

You can use your terminal to verify that myhosts has been created: `cat myhosts`{{execute}}

You can also run the following command to verify that your inventory is working properly:

`ansible all -i myhosts -m ping`{{execute}}

The response should look be:

<pre class="file">
localhost | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
</pre>

So, now that we have confirmed Ansible is properly configured, let's look at Ansible Playbooks.
