# Logging in and navigating Web Console 

Now that the required software is installed, it is time to configure and
enable terminal session recording.  You will use the Web Console to perform
this task.

Use the __Web Console__ tab in your lab environment to log into the Web
Console for the system.  You should use the following credentials:

Username: **rhel**  
Password: **redhat**

Now that you are logged into the Web console, and because you have installed
the `cockpit-session-recording` rpm package, you can now select the
__Session Recording__ option in the left-side navigation menu.
