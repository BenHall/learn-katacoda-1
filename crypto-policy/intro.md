# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, modify, and 
troubleshoot changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux's system-wide cryptographic 
policy.  The scenario uses the Apache web server as the example application. 


# Concepts included in this scenario:

* Verify the current system-wid cryptographic policy setting
* Change the current cryptographic policy setting
* Troubleshoot applications after a cryptographic policy update
* Modify application settings to comply with stronger cryptograpic policies

# Example Use case 
Your security team is recommending using more stringent crypto policies and is disallowing SHA-1 signature algorithm.
