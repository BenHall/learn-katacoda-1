Change directories to /data and start using
the filesystem

`cd /data`{{execute}}

To show the power of deduplication and how it can reduce storage costs 
in your data center,  we will create a file of random data, then make 
several copies of it.               

This dd command will generate a unique 1GB file.

`dd if=/dev/urandom of=/data/file.1 bs=1M count=1000`{{execute}}

When the file completes, we can check the output of          
VDO stats.

`vdostats --human-readable`{{execute}}

<pre class="file">
# vdostats --human-readable
Device                    Size      Used Available Use% Space saving%
/dev/mapper/vdo1         10.0G      5.0G      5.0G  49%            4%
</pre>

Note: the statistic "Used" might vary between 4.8G and 5.0G depending on
      how much compressible data is generated by /dev/urandom.
